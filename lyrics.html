            You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
            You know I try, but I don't do too well with apologies
            I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
            'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
            I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
            And by once or twice, I mean maybe a couple of hundred times
            So let me, oh, let me redeem, oh, redeem, oh, myself tonight
            'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances
            
            [Chorus]
            Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
            'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
            Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
            Yeah, I know that I let you down
            Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
            
            [Drop]
            I'm sorry, yeah
            Sorry, yeah
            Sorry
            Yeah, I know that I let you down
            Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

            I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
            But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
            I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
            Can we both say the words and forget this?
            
            [Chorus]
            Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?

            I'm not just tryna get you back on me (Oh, no, no)

            Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
